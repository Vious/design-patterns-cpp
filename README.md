# design-patterns-cpp
C++ based sample code for design patterns on the basic cases.

## Notes
This repo contains sample code for several design patterns implemented with c++. Most of the samples are re-implemented and code transfered from the book [Head First Design Patterns](),which I thought was quite a good one for beginners (though presented with the features of Java). Note there is no fixed pattern best suits for every cases, it really depends. 

For each pattern code in the sub-folder, there's a CMakeList.txt file provided, try compiling it by
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

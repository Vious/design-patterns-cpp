# Observer Pattern

A simple c++ code for observer pattern. The sample come from a classical book about design patterns, which is [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/9781492077992/). If you are interested, you may refer to the original book for more information. 

## The Weather Station

We still use the weather station example for implementing our own c++ observer pattern.
